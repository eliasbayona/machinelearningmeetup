# MACHINE LEARNING MEETUP 08-02-2020

This meetup is primarily geared at improving your machine learning skills
you will explore various machine learning techninques and algorithms
and implement them in a competition style project.

- 4:30 -- 5pm  RANKING AND PRESENTATIONS


## HACK SESSION TIPS

Participants are not expected to finish all the projects due to having relatively limited time :sob: rather attempt as many as you can.
Submissions for each project will be done on the projects respective platforms for ranking.
ie. - Submissions for the flight delay prediction challange will be done on zindi.africa.
    - PUBG Finish Placement Prediction (Kernels Only) on Kaggle.
    
This is done so participants can see how they also rank internationaly with other participants. :grin:
